chelp.sec.intro=Requirements towards security can vary greatly depending on the institution. Using the security the necessary security level can be configured taking into account the associated risk.  
chelp.sec.topframe=Select this security feature to prevent OpenOLAT from being loaded in a HTML frame or iFrame. By doing this will prevent possible Cross-Frame-Scripting attacks (XFS). If you enable this feature it is no longer possible to embedd OpenOLAT in an existing website using frames.  
chelp.sec.wiki=Select this security feature to disable the wiki resources system wide. At this time the wiki component is still prone to Cross-Site-Scripting attacks (XSS). When this feature is enabled, the wiki resources in OpenOLAT can no longer be used. When disabled, the wiki can be use with the risk of an XSS attack. However, since the wiki as an automatic revision mechanism it will be difficult for attackers to hide after an attack.
chelp.sec.force.download=Select this security setting to always dowload files from folders and never open them directly in the browser. This prevents possible Cross-Site-Scripting attacks (XSS). When this feature is enabled all documents are downloaded as files and will not be displayed in the browser directly, including HTML documents. This behavior does not apply to the course element "single page".

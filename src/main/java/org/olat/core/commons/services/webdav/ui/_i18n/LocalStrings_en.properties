admin.webdav.description=Using WebDAV you can mount and use OpenOLAT folders on your local desktop as if they were local folders. Enable this feature to make it accessable to all users of your platform. Please read the context help.
chelp.webdav.digest=To use WebDAV on Windows operating systems without manually importing certificates it is mandatory to operate the WebDAV interface using HTTP and no SSL. In that case files will be transfered without encryption. To still transmit the password encrypted, the Digest Authentication method must be used to support Windows.  
chelp.webdav.digest.disclaimer=The Digest Authentication method does not use strong encryption and can be cracked with enough computing effort. To meet very high security demands users should always use HTTPS with SSL encryption. When using Windows this will make it necessary to manually import certificates or to use a dedicated WebDAV client.
chelp.webdav.link=Decide if the WebDAV URL is displayed in the folder component or not. This is independent of the the WebDAV access. When disabled, WebDAV can still be used but the WebDAV link must be known by users as it is not displayed in the web interface.
chelp.webdav.module=Enable or disable the WebDAV access. When enabled, all system users can access their OpenOLAT folder using WebDAV (recommended).

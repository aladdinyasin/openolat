chelp.ced-lti-conf.title=Configure LTI page
chelp.lti.assessable=Select this checkbox when the LTI resource is generating a score value that can be transmitted to OpenOLAT using the LTI 1.1 standard. This is optional. The submitted score will appear on the users start screen of the LTI course element as well as in the efficiency statement of this course. Please be aware that according to the LTI standard only values between 0 and 1 are allowed.
chelp.lti.config=The following parameters can be configured\:
chelp.lti.cut=Here you can configure an optional cut value to define when the LTI course element is considered as being passed. The cut value relates to the score value after scaling and not to the raw value transmitted by LTI. In the example above a cut value of "5" is equivalent to "50%".
chelp.lti.data=To conform with data protection laws and privacy the user has to accept the transmission of personal data the first time he launches the service and whenever the configuration about transmitted data changes. 
chelp.lti.display=Select the option "$\:display.config.window.iframe" to embed the LTI resource within the course layout. The option "Display only module, hide LMS (iFrame)" completely hides OpenOLAT while the LTI module is active. With the option "$\:display.config.window.window" the LTI resource is opened in a separate window. This can be useful in case the resource needs a lot of space or has to be used in parallel with other course elements.
chelp.lti.info=More information about LTI can be found on the LTI project page\:
chelp.lti.pixel=Select "automatic" or an explicit size in case the automatic feature does not work properly.
chelp.lti.roles=Here you can configure which role the user will have when launching the LTI resource. The three OpenOLAT roles $\:author.roles, $\:coach.roles and $\:participant.roles are supported. For each role the mapping can be defined to a corresponding role on the LTI resource. The following LTI roles are available\: $\:roles.lti.learner, $\:roles.lti.instructor, $\:roles.lti.administrator, $\:roles.lti.teachingAssistant, $\:roles.lti.contentDeveloper and $\:roles.lti.mentor.
chelp.lti.scale=With the scaling factor the LTI results, which must have a value between 0 and 1 according to the LTI specification, can be scaled to a more practical value for the OpenOLAT course. For example, if you want an LTI exam to have a maximum of 10 points in OpenOLAT, you must specify a scaling factor of "10". If you want the transmitted score to be unmodified, use the factor "1".
chelp.lti10=You can add additional parameters inside this input box that should be transferred to a learning application. You can e.g. tell this learning application to transfer a query from the learning platform OLAT. (External learning applications have to be able to process such transferred information; therefore it is necessary to have an agreement with your provider.)
chelp.lti11=You have the choice between text attributes (identical values for each user) and additional dynamic user attributes (different for each user). You can add as many attributes as you wish, but note that the LTI resource must know which attributes are sent as this is not specified in the standard.
chelp.lti12=By checking this box other users will be able to see the information sent. This information includes parameters such as user identification, course title, course element, etc.
chelp.lti13=By clicking on "Launch Endpoint with BasicLTI Data" in the course view on top of your display of the data sent you will get to the homepage of your learning application.
chelp.lti2=By means of a LTI page you can embed external software into your course, e.g. chats, media Wikis, test editors, or virtual chemistry labs.
chelp.lti3=When selecting a LTI page from the navigation users will see any learning applications that are embedded in an OLAT course.
chelp.lti4=Any user data, course information or keys will be safely transferred to your embedded learning application in the background. Your learning application will verify any rights to grant access if the keys provided are valid.
chelp.lti5=Please indicate the address of your external learning application in the format "http\://wiscrowd.appspot.com/wiscrowd/" inside this input box.
chelp.lti6=Please indicate the key provided by the supplier of your external learning application (in the example above this would be "12345").
chelp.lti7=Please indicate the corresponding password to your key provided by the supplier of your external learning application (in the example above this would be "secret").
chelp.lti8=By checking this box a user's first and last name will be transferred to your external learning application. Otherwise users will be able to use this application anonymously.
chelp.lti9=By checking this box a user's e-mail address will be transferred to your external learning application.

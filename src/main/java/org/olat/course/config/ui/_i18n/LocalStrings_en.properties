chelp.eff3=<strong>Generate PDF certificate:</strong> Here you determine whether the participants of your course should receive a printable certificate, stating the successful completion of the course.

This selection allows for the use of certificates in courses without any assessable course elements.
chelp.eff4=Usually, a systemwide PDF template, specified beforehand by an administrator, should be available. If however, you wish to utilize your own individual template, you can upload one in the <strong>Certificate template</strong> section.  A PDF template though is no ordinary PDF file, but has to be either a PDF form created with e.g. Acrobat Pro, or a HTML form. The form fields then must contain specific variables, which will be replaced by the system upon certificate creation with the respective values.

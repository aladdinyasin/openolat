chelp.log2=This ZIP file contains the files $\:chelp.logStat und $\:chelp.logAdm .
chelp.log3=If your OLAT authority is set accordingly it will additionally contain the file $\:chelp.logUser to be dealt with elsewhere.

chelp.log5=Each course participant receives a number (e.g. *7FFBA8C371B1A3DACCF5F12227A75CE82D6C4CE6) generated at random; this number remains unchanged within a course.
